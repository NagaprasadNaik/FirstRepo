What is React?
ReactJS, a JavaScript library for creating user interfaces,makes the development of UI components easy and modular.

The key features of React are:

Component-based architecture: A Component is the smallest unit in a React application. Anything that you want to render on the browser can be rendered through components. Components help in maintainability and re-usability.
Virtual DOM: React uses virtual DOM concept for DOM manipulation which improves the performance of the application
Unidirectional data flow:  React’s one-way data flow (also called one-way binding) keeps everything modular and fast and easy for debugging.
JSX syntax: React used JSX syntax which is similar to XML and HTML syntax which makes it easy for writing markup and binding events in components 
SEO performance: The SEO performance can be improved using the server-side rendering concept. We can develop isomorphic applications using React which increases the SEO performance.


To install create-react-app, follow the below steps:
1. Install node.js with version 14+ from Node.js official site or from Software House
D:\> node -v
2. Install create-react-app by running the following command:
D:\>npm install -g create-react-app
3. Once the installation is done, create a React app using the below command:
D:\>create-react-app my-app
​​​​​​​​​​​​​​If you do not want to install create-react-app then you can use the below command to create a React application
After successful compilation, the application will be loaded in the browser at the port "http://localhost:3000" as shown below.

Virtual DOM?
Virtual DOM is an abstraction of actual DOM, where components are the nodes. We can programmatically modify virtual DOM by updating components. These updates are internally handled by React and in turn, updated in actual DOM.
As we all know, DOM manipulation is expensive, because it requires traversal through entire DOM tree to find the element to be updated. If these updates are very frequent, this leads to a poor performance of an application.
What is React component?
A React component is the fundamental unit of any React application. They are capable of encapsulating data and view as a single unit. These components can work in conjunction with each other.

Components make code reusable, testing easy, and can take care of separation of concerns.

Here, in ReactJS, components reside in virtual DOM and these components will be available as nodes in actual DOM.
